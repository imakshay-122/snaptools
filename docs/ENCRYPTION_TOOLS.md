## Symmetric Encryption Tools

### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

#### What is this tool?
AES is a widely-adopted, highly secure symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a single secret key for both encryption and decryption of data. It's considered the gold standard in encryption technology and is used by governments, financial institutions, and organizations worldwide.

#### Why use this tool?
- Provides military-grade security for sensitive data
- Offers excellent performance and efficiency
- Widely supported across different platforms and programming languages
- Approved by the National Security Agency (NSA) for top secret information

#### Where to use it?
- Encrypting sensitive files and documents
- Securing database contents
- Protecting cloud storage data
- Implementing secure communication channels
- Safeguarding financial transactions

#### How to use it?
1. **Key Generation**:
   - Choose a strong secret key (256-bit recommended)
   - Never reuse keys across different applications

2. **Encryption Process**:
   ```javascript
   const encrypted = AES.encrypt(plaintext, secretKey, {
     mode: 'CBC',
     padding: 'PKCS7'
   });
   ```

3. **Decryption Process**:
   ```javascript
   const decrypted = AES.decrypt(ciphertext, secretKey, {
     mode: 'CBC',
     padding: 'PKCS7'
   });
   ```

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Use a secure random number generator for key generation
   - Implement proper key management
   - Add salt to prevent rainbow table attacks
   - Use appropriate modes of operation (CBC, GCM)

### DES (Data Encryption Standard)

#### What is this tool?
DES is a legacy symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a 56-bit key to encrypt and decrypt data. It was once the federal standard for data encryption but has been superseded by more secure algorithms like AES.

#### Why use this tool?
- Legacy system compatibility
- Understanding historical encryption methods
- Maintaining backward compatibility
- Processing legacy data formats

#### Where to use it?
- Legacy systems that require DES compatibility
- Historical data processing

#### How to use it?
1. **Key Setup**:
   ```javascript
   const key = generateDESKey(); // 56-bit key
   ```

2. **Encryption**:
   ```javascript
   const encrypted = DES.encrypt(plaintext, key);
   ```

3. **Decryption**:
   ```javascript
   const decrypted = DES.decrypt(ciphertext, key);
   ```

**Important Security Note**: DES is considered cryptographically weak by modern standards. For new applications, use AES instead.

### Triple DES (3DES)

#### What is this tool?

   const key3 = generateKey(); // Third 56-bit key
   ```

2. **Encryption Process**:
   ```javascript
   const encrypted = TripleDES.encrypt(plaintext, [key1, key2, key3], {
     mode: 'CBC',
     padding: 'PKCS7'
   });
   ```

3. **Decryption Process**:
   ```javascript
   const decrypted = TripleDES.decrypt(ciphertext, [key1, key2, key3], {
